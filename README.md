Just some scripts, which I want to be public accessible

## crackpw.py
This is a really tiny tool to do a brute force attack against a hash with a wordlist. I also uploaded rockyou.txt to have it in one place.
At the moment only md5 is implemented, but everything else should be super easy to adapt, if you need to.
